Build a routine:
(1) Lights dimmed at least an hour before bedtime
I prefer a lamp in the evening hours once the sun is down
(2) Best to read in the hour before bedtime
(3) Avoid food in the 3 hours before bedtime
(4) Magnesium Glycinate (100mg) + Melatonin (max 5 mg)

Goal is consistently employing the routine at the same time each night
Go to bed and wake up at same time each night
