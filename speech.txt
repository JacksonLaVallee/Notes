Starting a speech:

One should start a speech in one of three ways, ranked in order of ability to captivate:
(1) With a story
"Once upon a time..."
"In May of 2011..."
(2) With a fact
"There are more people alive today than have ever died in the history of humanity."
"Every two minutes, the energy reaching the earth from the sun is equivalent to the annual energy usage of humanity."
(3) With a question
"What are the first words you should say in a speech, and what are the last words you should say in a speech?"

Stories carry great weight and value. The importance of stories is indispensable. Thus, one should pursue a life where stories naturally fall out.

How? By meeting interesting people. Taking every opportunity that comes up. Find the people at the top and learn from them.

How to speak:

(1) Do NOT start with a joke
(2) Tell them what they'll learn (a promise)
(3) Cycle (repeat your ideas) -- are we sure...?
(4) Why is your idea unique?
(5) Summarize -- this serves as punctuation
(6) Ask questions -- we've seen this before

Place and time:

(7) 11 AM (not too early, but before lunch)
(8) Well-lit
(9) Seen and checked before -- so prepare and understand the space
(10) Doesn't have to be full, but more than half

Teaching:
(11) Use the board -- I think chalk is the best. It creates the highest contrast, your lines are smoother, and your strokes are heard (audible) -- engaging
(12) Props -- visuals

Job:
(13) Don't put too many words. Slide should reflect what you're saying.
(14) Pictures attract attention
(15) Slides should be easy to read, NO DISTRACTIONS
(16) Lazers are bad, use arrows on the slide. DON'T LOSE EYE CONTACT OF AUDIENCE

Inform:
(17) Show your vision
(18) Show what you've done
(19) Be quick/concise
(20) Establish credibility early (you're not a rookie)

Being remembered (fame):
(21) Symbols -- those which can be associated with you
(22) Slogan
(23) Surprise -- can intertwine with fact (common fallacy)
(24) Salient Idea -- key takeaway
(25) Story -- how you did it/how it works

How to end:
(26) Collaborators at the BEGINNING not end
(27) Questions are an atrocious way to end a talk
(28) End with a contribution slide -- what have we done today? what have I showed? list these and pause, let the audience read and reflect
(29) Potentially tell a joke -- people leave feeling fun and have a good memory of your talk
(30) End with a quote of a prominent person
(31) DO NOT SAY THANK YOU -- it's trite; you're boring
You're implying they're so polite that they stayed to listen!!
"Thank you for listening" is the worst!!
(32) Or just salut the audience. "It's been wonderful being here and seeing the great work you're doing at MIT and I look forward to the next time I get to speak here."
